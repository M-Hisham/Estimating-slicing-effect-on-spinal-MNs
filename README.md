# Estimating-the-effects-of-slicing-on-the-electrophysiological-properties-of-spinal-motoneurons-under-normal-and-disease-conditions
This readme file is to assist in running the simulations published in the modeling study entitled <b><i>“Estimating the effects of slicing on the electrophysiological properties of spinal motoneurons under normal and disease conditions”</i></b> by Mohamed H. Mousa and Sherif M. Elbasiouny.

## Platform:
* Files are written in hoc & Python. 
* Requires Python2.7
* Run the simulations on the  [NEURON simulator](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/what_is_neuron) platform

## Requirments:
1. [Install](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/py_doc/programming/python.html) the neuron simulator with Python 2 
2. Compile the mod files.

## Files description
* .hoc files are for the full and the sliced models of MN#3
* .mod files are for the active channels included in the cell models
* .py files are for adding the dendritic CaPIC channels.
